# GlaDOS AmongUs Bot

GlaDOS is a player bot for Among Us. The project is written in C# and I apologize to everyone who will ever laid eyes on this code. It's bad. 

The bot will work on v2020.12.9s. Every new patch will require updates to memory pointers.

The project utilises memory scan from shlifedev to process game events.

## Features:
- Crewmate gameplay
- Imposter gameplay
- Task solvers
- Emergency meetings reports (the bot will list its activities during the round)
- Body reports
- LOTS OF BUGS

## Getting started:
Find the binary in the releases. Run it during the round / in game lobby. Pray it doesn't crash. It shouldn't. But it can. And probably will.

The bot will talk through the audio output. In order to pipe it into discord as an input, I recommend using VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device.

If you want to make any code changes, I wish you luck in that dark place. I didn't leave any comments and the structure is a complete disaster. It was never meant to see the light of day.

Also, it requires a lot of processing power and DDR4 RAM. DDR3 just... isn't fast enough. Trust me, I built an entire new PC for this thing to run on and DDR3 just didn't cut it.
